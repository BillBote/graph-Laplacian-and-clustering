# graph-Laplacian-and-clustering

This project is my research project during master degree. I work on Graph Laplician and try to find some methods to detect objects inspiring from graph Laplacian and Spectrum clustering. And I will record some progress here and upload corresponding code.

## Task 1
Read paper *ON THE CONSISTENCY OF GRAPH-BASED BAYESIAN LEARNING AND THE SCALABILITY OF SAMPLING ALGORITHMS* and know what is Graph Laplacian. This is a theoretical part.

### Notation

$\mathcal{M}$: m-dimentional, compact, smooth, manifold embedded in $R^d$

$\mathcal{M}_n={x_1,...,x_n}$

$L^2(r):$ space of functions on underlying manifold, Square Integrable Functions in $L^2(r)$ can be writen in terms of the (normalized) eigenfunctions ${phi_i}_{i=1}^{\infty}$ of Laplacian Beltrami operator $\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}$. ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial \\theta_k^{(j)}}=\\sum_{i:r(i,j)=1}{\\big((\\theta^{(j)})^Tx^{(i)}-y^{(i,j)}\\big)x_k^{(i)}}+\\lambda \\theta_k^{(j)})
