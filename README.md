# graph-Laplacian-and-clustering

This project is my research project during master degree. I work on Graph Laplician and try to find some methods to detect objects inspiring from graph Laplacian and Spectrum clustering. And I will record some progress here and upload corresponding code.

## Task 1
Read paper *ON THE CONSISTENCY OF GRAPH-BASED BAYESIAN LEARNING AND THE SCALABILITY OF SAMPLING ALGORITHMS* and know what is Graph Laplacian.
